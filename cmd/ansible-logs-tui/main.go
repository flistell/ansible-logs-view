package placeholder

// This file is intentionally minimal. The CLI entrypoint lives at repository root
// (main.go). If you prefer a cmd/ layout, move the root main.go into this
// directory and ensure shared packages are exported or moved into an internal
// package that both cmd and tests can import.
